                **Knowing the basic of RGB**
                The RGB color model is one of the most well-known color system which are used in computers üíª, televisions üì∫, and electronic devices üì± for displaying colors.

                Each color you see on your display is a combination of the 3 primary colors, each primary color will have a value range from 0 to 255.

                    For Example:
                    - üî¥ Red will have (255, 0, 0)
                    - üü¢ Green - (0, 255, 0)
                    - üîµ Blue - (0, 0, 255)

                See how each of our primary color has number '255' on different places?

                 To demonstrate mixing color, I have chosen RGB color model for the simulation, since it is pretty straightforward in terms of how colors are mixed together.

                 Starting by switching off one of the hose‚Äôs toggle. Look at the change in the water! Because the water is a mixture of each hose's color, thus turning off a hose will result in a color change.

                 Now try choosing a different color for the hose. You can try as many combination as you like. Try adding Red and Blue together to get Purple, or mix Yellow with Blue to get Green. Also, turn back on all of the three hoses, and see how many variant of a single similar color (like blue, navy, teal, indigo) you can make out of!

                 **More fact**
                 *The output color for RGB color model is calculated by adding up all the r, g, and b values of the input colors, then divide it by the number of input colors.*

                    For example:
                    1. üî¥ Red (255, 0, 0) + üîµ Blue (0, 0, 255) = (255, 0, 255)
                    2. Then divide (255, 0, 255) by 2 (since we are adding only 2 colors)
                    3. We‚Äôll get (127.5, 0, 127.5), which is üü£ Purple!
